<p style="width: 500px;">A website (also written as a web site) is one or more <a href="">web pages </a>and related content that is
 identified by a common <a href="">domain name</a> and published on at least one <a href="">web server</a>. Websites are 
 typically dedicated to a particular topic or purpose, such as news, education, commerce,
 entertainment, or <a href="">social media</a>. <a href="">Hyperlinking</a> between web pages guides the navigation of the
 site, which often starts with a <a href="">home page</a>. The mo <a href="">st visited</a> sites are <a href=""> Google</a>, YouTube, and
<a href=""> Facebook</a>.</p>
 <p style="width: 500px;">All publicly-accessible websites collectively constitute the <a href="">World Wide Web</a>. There are also
 private websites that can only be accessed on a <a href=""> private network</a>, such as a company's internal
 website for its employees. <a href=""> Users </a> can access websites on a range of devices, including
<a href=""> desktops, laptops, tablets</a>, and <a href="">smartphones</a>. The app used on these devices is called a web
 <a href="">browser</a>.</p>
